This project uses 3 main technologies: 
Node.js - as the server
Express.js - to be more efficent in the creation of the server
Sequelize - The ORM, initially used for more out of the box protection against many basic attacks like SQL injection.

To install: 
You will need to change the connection parameters in index.js around line 9 to the correct mysql server that you're running.
you will also need to ensure the database that you are connecting too exists. I did this with mysql workbench.

running npm start from the terminal should then get the site up and running.
